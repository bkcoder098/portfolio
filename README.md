# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh



// I  made a presonal portfolio website which is completly functionable. In this project I use ReactJs, and TailwindCSS and for icons i use React icon Library  and  also i use Gsap  library  for animation to enhence the UI.

 I am beginner so i put so many effort to make this project and phasing  many errors  which is difficult for me that's it.I am trying to build more  efficient and scalable project..
